<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Let's implement the simplest search engine possible. It should search for a specific word from the line containing different words.</p>

<p>The first line contains several words separated by a space. The words are numbered according to their order, with the first word having index 1. Consider that all the words in the first line are unique, so there can be no repetitions.</p>

<p><strong>Write a small program </strong>that reads a single line and then another line. The word to search for is in the first line. The program should output the index of this word in the first line. If there is no such word in the first line, the program should print <code class="java">"Not Found"</code>. Please remember that indexes start from 1!</p>

<p>You should output exactly one line.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
